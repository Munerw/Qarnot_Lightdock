# LightDock 4G6M example

This is a complete example of the LightDock protocol when residue restraints are specified using the [4G6M](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4g6m) complex as an example.

All the files used in this example can be found in the path [examples/4G6M](https://github.com/brianjimenez/lightdock/tree/master/examples/4G6M).

**IMPORTANT: We recommend you to create a new folder and to copy the starting files `4G6M_rec.pdb`, `4G6M_lig.pdb` and `restraints.list` to that folder in case you would like to run this example.**

## 1. Setup

First, run the setup:

```
lightdock_setup 4G6M_rec.pdb 4G6M_lig.pdb 400 200 -anm --noxt -rst restraints.list
```

The output should be something like this:

``` 
@> ProDy is configured: verbosity='info'

```

## 2. Simulation

We can run our simulation in a local machine or in a HPC cluster. For the first option, simply run the following command:

```
lightdock setup.json 100 -s fastdfire -c 8
```

Where the flag `-c 8` indicates LightDock to use 8 available cores. For this example we will run `100` steps of the protocol and the C implementation of the DFIRE function `-s fastdfire`.


To run a LightDock job on a HPC cluster, a Portable Batch System (PBS) file can be generated. This PBS file defines the commands and cluster resources used for the job. A PBS file is a plain-text file that can be easily edited with any UNIX editor. For example, create a `submit_job.sh` file containing:

```
#PBS -N LightDock-4G6M
#PBS -q medium
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=16
#PBS -S /bin/bash
#PBS -d ./
#PBS -e ./lightdock.err
#PBS -o ./lightdock.out

lightdock setup.json 100 -s fastdfire -c 16
```

This script tells the PBS queue manager to use 16 cores of a single node in a queue with name `medium`, with job name `LigthDock-4G6M` and with standard output to `lightdock.out` and error output redirected to `lightdock.err`.

To run this script you can do it so:

```
qsub < submit_job.sh
```

## 3. Analysis

Once the simulation has finished (it takes around 1-2 min per 10 steps per swarm), you should:

1. Generate structures per swarm (200 glowworms per swarm in this example)
2. Cluster predictions per swarm
3. Generate the ranking files
4. Filter by a percentage of satisfied restraints (>40% in this example)

Here there is a PBS script to do so:

```
#PBS -N 4G6M-anal
#PBS -q medium
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=8
#PBS -S /bin/bash
#PBS -d ./
#PBS -e ./analysis.err
#PBS -o ./analysis.out

### Calculate the number of swarms ###

s=`ls -d ./swarm_* | wc -l`
swarms=$((s-1))


### Create files for Ant-Thony ###

for i in $(seq 0 $swarms)
  do
    echo "cd swarm_${i}; lgd_generate_conformations.py ../4G6M_rec.pdb ../4G6M_lig.pdb  gso_100.out 200 > /dev/null 2> /dev/null;" >> generate_lightdock.list;
  done

for i in $(seq 0 $swarms)
  do
    echo "cd swarm_${i}; lgd_cluster_bsas.py gso_100.out > /dev/null 2> /dev/null;" >> cluster_lightdock.list;
  done


### Generate LightDock models ###

ant_thony.py -c 8 generate_lightdock.list;


### Clustering BSAS (rmsd) within swarm ###

ant_thony.py -c 8 cluster_lightdock.list;


### Generate ranking files for filtering ###

lgd_rank.py $s 100;


### Filtering models by >40% of satisfied restraints ### 

lgd_filter_restraints.py --cutoff 5.0 --fnat 0.4 rank_by_scoring.list restraints.list A B > /dev/null 2> /dev/null;

```

When the analysis is finished, a new folder called `filtered` has been created, which contains any predicted structure which satisfies our 40% filter and a file with the ranking of these structures by LightDock DFIRE (fastdfire) energy (more positive better) `rank_filtered.list`.

We provide for this example a compressed filtered folder [filtered.tgz](../examples/4G6M/filtered.tgz) which contains (when decompressed) a ranking `lgd_filtered_rank.list` file. For all the filtered structures, interface RMSD (i-RMSD), ligand RMSD (l-RMSD) and fraction of native contacts (fnc) according to CAPRI criteria has been calculated:

```
$ head lgd_filtered_rank.list
# structure    i-RMSD  l-RMSD  fnc      Score
swarm_83_154.pdb	2.091	2.012	0.603448	56.869
swarm_50_151.pdb	3.082	4.001	0.327586	50.536
swarm_7_192.pdb	1.553	1.461	0.586207	48.936
swarm_36_168.pdb	1.132	1.385	0.827586	48.870
swarm_48_19.pdb	3.687	4.205	0.258621	48.739
swarm_11_136.pdb	2.231	2.390	0.448276	48.662
swarm_52_171.pdb	3.933	4.052	0.155172	47.808
swarm_49_183.pdb	3.589	3.775	0.258621	47.659
swarm_48_49.pdb	1.562	2.100	0.793103	47.234
swarm_65_93.pdb	1.282	1.130	0.844828	45.372
```

As you may observe, for this example our protocol seems to perform extremely well when restraints close to the true interface are specified.
