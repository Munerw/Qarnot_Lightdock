## 1. General

### 1.1. What is *ab initio*?
Blinded docking or *ab initio* is the protocol to execute when no additional information is provided for performing the docking (residue restraints, etc.).

Default recommended protocol is:

* **Swarms**: 400
* **Glowworms**: 300
* **Steps**: 100

In the [original publication](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/1/49/4103399) the number of steps was equal to 200, but quality of the results is not affected using 100 steps and it was only for benchmarking that 200 steps were used. 


## 2. Setup

### 2.1. Removing previous files when setup fails
If LightDock setup fails and no `setup.json` file is generated, all files generated by LightDock should be deleted. This is critical as LightDock may append PDB structures parsed to `lightdock_*.pdb` existing PDB files, with the result of multiple structures per PDB file.


## 3. Simulation

### 3.1. DFIRE fails with KeyError

DFIRE scoring function fails with a similar error to this example:

```
File "/home/software/lightdock/lightdock/scoring/dfire/driver.py", line 152, in _get_docking_model
anuma = atomnumber[rec_atom_type]
KeyError: 'LYSH1'
```

This is caused by DFIRE scoring functions not recognizing `H` (hydrogen) atoms. Remove all hydrogen atoms and any other non-standard residue or `HETATM`.

For removing hydrogens, you can use `reduce` software:

```
reduce -Trim input.pdb > output.pdb
```
